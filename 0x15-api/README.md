# API

API, or Application Programming Interfaces are everywhere these days, thanks to microservice architecture.
An API is a way a system defines that allows it's surroundings or other external systems to talk to it.
In a microservice architecture, a whole application is broken down into smaller, independent services, that can be deployed and scaled independently. Each of these services then defines how other services that want to read, modify, create or delete data from it should go ahead with it. This is it's API.

REST, or Representational State Transfer is the most common form of designing APIs at the internet. This is because it is simple to build and use.

In this project, we use python's Requests library to read and process data from [this api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
This project is composed of 4 solutions for 4 tasks:
- [0-gather\_data\_from\_an\_API.py](./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py)
- [1-export\_to\_CSV.py](./1-export_to_CSV.py)
- [2-export\_to\_JSON.py](./2-export_to_JSON.py), and
- [3-dictionary\_of\_list\_of\_dictionaries.py](./3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py)
